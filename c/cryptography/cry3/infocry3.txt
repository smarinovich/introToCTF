Computers can store data in binary (1s and 0s). This is sometimes represented as hexadecimal, which reduces 4 characters to 1. The entire english alphabet can be represented in ASCII, meaning we can encode things, like flags with it.
Often one cipher might not be enough, and inorder to protect our data it might be encoded multiple times. The second cipher used, the Casear Cipher, rotates all the alphabet letters, where each letter is replaced with one that is 3 after it.
