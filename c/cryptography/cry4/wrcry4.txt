Step 1
The hint implies that the code has been encoded in base64 twice. Decoding the first time gets: LS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLyAtLS0tLSAuLS0tLSAtLS0tLSAuLS0tLSAtLS0tLSAuLS0tLSAtLS0tLSAtLS0tLSAvIC0tLS0tIC4tLS0tIC0tLS0tIC0tLS0tIC0tLS0tIC0tLS0tIC4tLS0tIC4tLS0tIC8gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLyAtLS0tLSAuLS0tLSAtLS0tLSAtLS0tLSAtLS0tLSAtLS0tLSAuLS0tLSAuLS0tLSAvIC0tLS0tIC4tLS0tIC4tLS0tIC4tLS0tIC0tLS0tIC0tLS0tIC4tLS0tIC0tLS0tIC8gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLyAtLS0tLSAuLS0tLSAuLS0tLSAuLS0tLSAtLS0tLSAtLS0tLSAtLS0tLSAtLS0tLSAvIC0tLS0tIC0tLS0tIC4tLS0tIC4tLS0tIC0tLS0tIC0tLS0tIC0tLS0tIC0tLS0tIC8gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLyAtLS0tLSAtLS0tLSAuLS0tLSAuLS0tLSAtLS0tLSAtLS0tLSAtLS0tLSAtLS0tLSAvIC0tLS0tIC4tLS0tIC4tLS0tIC0tLS0tIC0tLS0tIC4tLS0tIC4tLS0tIC4tLS0tIC8gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLyAtLS0tLSAtLS0tLSAuLS0tLSAuLS0tLSAtLS0tLSAuLS0tLSAtLS0tLSAtLS0tLSAvIC0tLS0tIC4tLS0tIC4tLS0tIC4tLS0tIC0tLS0tIC0tLS0tIC0tLS0tIC0tLS0tIC8gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLyAtLS0tLSAuLS0tLSAtLS0tLSAuLS0tLSAuLS0tLSAtLS0tLSAtLS0tLSAuLS0tLSAvIC0tLS0tIC4tLS0tIC0tLS0tIC4tLS0tIC4tLS0tIC4tLS0tIC4tLS0tIC4tLS0tIC8gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLyAtLS0tLSAtLS0tLSAuLS0tLSAuLS0tLSAtLS0tLSAtLS0tLSAtLS0tLSAtLS0tLSAvIC0tLS0tIC4tLS0tIC4tLS0tIC4tLS0tIC0tLS0tIC0tLS0tIC4tLS0tIC4tLS0tIC8gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLyAtLS0tLSAuLS0tLSAuLS0tLSAuLS0tLSAuLS0tLSAuLS0tLSAtLS0tLSAuLS0tLQ==
Step 2
We then decode in base64 again. Once decoded you will get:----- .---- ----- ----- .---- ----- ----- .---- / ----- .---- ----- .---- ----- .---- ----- ----- / ----- .---- ----- ----- ----- ----- .---- .---- / ----- .---- .---- .---- .---- ----- .---- .---- / ----- .---- ----- ----- ----- ----- .---- .---- / ----- .---- .---- .---- ----- ----- .---- ----- / ----- ----- .---- .---- ----- .---- ----- ----- / ----- .---- .---- .---- ----- ----- ----- ----- / ----- ----- .---- .---- ----- ----- ----- ----- / ----- .---- .---- .---- ----- .---- ----- ----- / ----- ----- .---- .---- ----- ----- ----- ----- / ----- .---- .---- ----- ----- .---- .---- .---- / ----- .---- .---- .---- ----- ----- .---- ----- / ----- ----- .---- .---- ----- .---- ----- ----- / ----- .---- .---- .---- ----- ----- ----- ----- / ----- .---- ----- ----- .---- ----- ----- ----- / ----- .---- ----- .---- .---- ----- ----- .---- / ----- .---- ----- .---- .---- .---- .---- .---- / ----- .---- ----- ----- ----- ----- .---- ----- / ----- ----- .---- .---- ----- ----- ----- ----- / ----- .---- .---- .---- ----- ----- .---- .---- / ----- .---- ----- .---- ----- ----- .---- .---- / ----- .---- .---- .---- .---- .---- ----- .----
Step 3
This is in morse code. Decode the morse code to get: 01001001 01010100 01000011 01111011 01000011 01110010 00110100 01110000 00110000 01110100 00110000 01100111 01110010 00110100 01110000 01001000 01011001 01011111 01000010 00110000 01110011 01010011 01111101
Step 4
The data is encoded as binary data. Convert it using ASCII to find the flag
