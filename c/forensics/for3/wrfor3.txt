Internet spiders refer to webcrawlers. Webcrawlers are often redirected to robots.txt. After visitng /s/robots.txt, there is a snippet from lord of the rings. In one of the songs (the user is directed at the end of a file), there is a directory for them to check (src/this/path/is/very/long/but/the/goal/is/here.txt). Upon visitng, the flag is there.
