        Here's some info on the challenges you completed. The more challenges you complete, the more info you'll
        recieve.
        <h5><b>Forensics</b></h5>
        <div id="for">
            <div id="for1" class="incomplete">
                Foresnics is about exploring different files and their properties. Sometimes flags could be hidden in
                the metadata, like the flag.<br>
            </div>
            <div id="for2" class="incomplete">
                Terminals have a series of commands that help with the analysis of files, such as strings (prints out
                all the printable characters in a file), grep (which can find matching patterns in a file) and binwalk
                (searches a file for embedded files and exectuable code).<br>
            </div>
            <div id="for3" class="incomplete">
                Websites host more information then just the html. Sometimes other files, like .txt, .md files are
                stored for information.<br>
                Webcrawlers will try to help reduce the workload on websites by visiting robots.txt. Developers can use
                this as a message dump also. Foresnics focuses on your use to explore the present materials.<br>
            </div>
            <div id="for4" class="incomplete">
                Data we may still need to access may still be encoded. This can be encoded as base64, but could also be
                in any form.<br>
                Compression systems like zip still result in binary data, allowing us to manipulate it and encode
                it.<br>
            </div>
        </div>
        <h5><b>Cryptography</b></h5>
        <div id="cry">
            <div id="cry1" class="incomplete">
                Ciphers allow for users to encode messages. A poliybus cipher is an example where numbers are used
                instead of letters, and all letters are put into a grid.<br>
            </div>
            <div id="cry2" class="incomplete">
                The computer can encode and decode data, using special functions like base64, base32, hex, decimal. This
                can allow the data to be stored in a more optimal way for the computer, and makes it harder for humans
                to understand.<br>
            </div>
            <div id="cry3" class="incomplete">
                Computers can store data in binary (1s and 0s). This is sometimes represented as hexadecimal, which
                reduces 4 characters to 1. The entire english alphabet can be represented in ASCII, meaning we can
                encode things, like flags with it.
                Often one cipher might not be enough, and inorder to protect our data it might be encoded multiple
                times. The second cipher used, the Casear Cipher, rotates all the alphabet letters, where each letter is
                replaced with one that is 3 after it.<br>
            </div>
            <div id="cry4" class="incomplete">
                Encoding strategies don't have any restrictions on how many times they can be applied. Some other common
                strategies for encoding including Morse Code, Subsitution Ciphers and Vigen√®re Ciphers.<br>
            </div>
        </div>
        <h5><b>Buffer Overflows</b></h5>
        <div id="buf">
            <div id="buf1" class="incomplete">
                A buffer overflow is when you overwrite data past the buffer and start altering other parts of memory. A
                key way this happens is by using gets instead of fgets.<br>
            </div>
            <div id="buf2" class="incomplete">
                Despite how fgets how the safety of limiting the buffer amount, programers sometimes may leave the size
                buffer too big on fgets, which allows for overwrite.<br>
            </div>
            <div id="buf3" class="incomplete">
                It's safer to write a program that verifies you have something is correct rather then something is
                wrong. There's only one possible correct answers, while there's infinite incorrect ones. <br>
            </div>
            <div id="buf4" class="incomplete">
                A stack canary is used to ensure the code is not altered. This is a segment in memory which is in the
                middle of the variables that we may want to change, and is checked after memory input.<br>
